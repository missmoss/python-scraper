They said they didn't have anything of the sort and were going to charge me for a regular Egg McMuffin (which costs over $3.50 because of the sausage and cheese).\\n\\nMaking it more frustrating, the person working the register was Chinese and hardly knew how to speak English, to the point that I had to point at the menu. That was literally my experience in China, except the employees at McDonald's in China can understand you a bit quicker.\\n\\nMeanwhile a shift manager or manager or whoever he was, stood in the back looking on. He finally stepped in to lecture me that he wouldn't be giving me a discount on the sandwich. Managers are there to reduce friction and make exceptions if it keeps someone coming back. But nope, attitude instead.\",\n",

I tried to let it go, however, I go to Mc Donalds once a week to get my \" cheating meal\" for quite a few years now... not a big deal : 1 mc flurry with hot fudge on top, always around 3 dol.\\nAnywhere I go, for the past few years I always had the same product...same price.\\nSome stores don\\'t even charge me extra for the hot fudge, but some charge me $0.25 which is fine. \\n\\nWell, this lady decided to charge me 5 dol for the usual 3 dol Mc Flurry, and not telling me what the charge was... Surprised by the 5 dol charge, I asked if she got my order correct. She ignored me and kept looking to the door ( not sure who she was waiting for ). i asked again if the order was correct and she look at me, rolled her eyes and say \" you want hot fudge? thats the price!\" \\n\\nSo I asked to speak with the manager. She just canceled my order and got the next client WITHOUT CALLING THE MANAGER. Absolutely ignored me while I stand there looking at her. Once she finished with that customer, i stepped in and told her she wouldn\\'t get another client until she actually tell the manager Im here waiting. Are you kidding me ? She looked back to the manager ( who was actually there the entire time pretending he didn\\'t hear the situation) waved her head and without a word to me, just called the next customer. I was starting to get very upset. This is outrageous ! Specially for a company like Mc Donalds that I have never had this awful service in 10 years. Its unacceptable. \\n\\nThe manager made everything even worse. Just as rude as her, came already making a scene in front of everyone and with his zero customer service skills CLEARLY STATED THAT EVERY MC DONALDS STORE HAS THEIR OWN PRICE AND AT HIS STORE, IF I WANTED TO EAT IT THEN THAT IS THE PRICE I NEED TO PAY TO GET THE EXTRA HOT FUDGET. IF IM NOT HAPPY, LEAVE.\\n\\nyeah.. no doubt I left.\\nand will never ever come back !\\n\\nI wonder how and what kind of training a manager gets to have a job there.\\n',\n",
